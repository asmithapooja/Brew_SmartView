Pending works to do.

 --> Prebook search doesn't consider room status hence dirty room is showing as available room.
 --> New and Old dashboard should let the user know if the guest has been prebooked or regular checkin customer.
 --> New dashboard widget tile should include Upcoming Checkout, Upcoming Booking, Fav customers -- Done
 --> User should be able to switch between new and old dashboard effortless -- Done.
 
 --> userModel and roomListsModel should not get fetched everytime, rather it should first check if the data is there in the models, 
    and if yes proceed with the fetching or else update the models with the newly added models into the respective models.
